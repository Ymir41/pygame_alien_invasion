This is my old pygame project. I wrote it few years ago and barely revised, so the code is probably not the cleanest.

# How to get
## Linux and macOS
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Ymir41/pygame_alien_invasion.git
cd pygame_alien_invasion
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running
Make sure you are useing write python environment (in pygame_alien_invasion directory run `source .venv/bin/activate`).
## On Linux and macOS
``` bash
python main/__init__.py
```
## On Windows
``` console
python main\__init__.py
```
